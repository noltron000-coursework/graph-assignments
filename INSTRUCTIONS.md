## General instructions
- Your code should go in the Challenge Folder of your personal repo that you created for this class.
- Create a separate folder for each challenge, and copy any code you are re-using from the previous challenge before modifying.  The code in each folder should only solve that challenge.
- Your code should meet the following minimum requirements
	- meets PEP8 style guidelines
	- is well tested
	- is well documented
	- cites any sources used for inspiration  and clearly indicates what code is used / modified from these sources

- Unless otherwise stated, use simple concrete data types in your implementations (lists, dictionaries). Stretch challenges will give you an opportunity to refactor with collections and more complex data types.

- Each challenge will read in a graphs from a text file with
	- the first line being a G or D (for graph or digraph)
	- the second line being a list of vertices,
	- remaining lines are one vertex pair per line representing the edges `(x,y)` or a triplet if there are weights ``(x, y, w)``

```
G
1,2,3,4
(1,2)
(1,4)
(2,3)
(2,4)
```

- Each challenge should be run from the command line and provide output in the format requested.

- Your code should be in at least two files.  File 1 must be named challege_X.py where X is the challenge number.  This file will be run from the command line with arguments of the graph text file and (possibly) additional arguments needed for the challenge.  `python3 challenge_1.py graph_data.txt`

- Other files should follow best practices for code architecture (classes in a file with the class name, etc) but the structure is up to you.

- You will be graded on if your code works (produces the correct output), and code quality based on the rubrics linked in each challenge.

## Challenge 1
- Implement the Graph ADT with an adjacency list
- Implement code to read in a graph from a text file to create an instance of the Graph ADT and use its methods.

**Input:** A graph file (can contain a directed or undirected graph with or without weights)
`python3 challenge_1.py graph_data.txt`
```
G
1,2,3,4
(1,2,10)
(1,4,5)
(2,3,5)
(2,4,7)
```

**Output:**
* The # vertices in the graph.
* The # edges in the graph.
* A list of the edges with their weights (if weighted)

```
# Vertices: 4
# Edges: 4
Edge List:
(1,2,10)
(1,4,5)
(2,3,5)
(2,4,7)

```



### Stretch Challenge 1
- Re-implement the Graph ADT using one of the [python collections](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/collections.html#module-collections).

## Challenge 2

**Create a Challenge_2 folder in your challenge repository.  Copy any code you want to re-use from Challenge 1 to that folder before modifying**

Update your Graph ADT code to use Breadth-first search to compute the shortest path between two provided vertices in your graph.  

**Input:** A graph file (containing an undirected, unweighted graph), a from_vertex and a to_vertex.

`python3 challenge_2.py graph_data.txt 1 5`

```
G
1,2,3,4,5
(1,2)
(1,4)
(2,3)
(2,4)
(2,5)
(3,5)
```

**Output:**
The vertices in a shortest path from `from_vertex` to `to_vertex` and the number of edges in that path.
```
Vertices in shortest path: 1,2,5
Number of edges in shortest path: 3

```
### [Challenge 2 Rubric](https://www.makeschool.com/rubrics/UnVicmljLTk=)

## Challenge 3

Update your Graph ADT code to do the following
1. Implement Recursive Depth-first search to determine if there is a path between two vertices in a weighted directed graph.  
1. Implement Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the minimum weight path between two vertices in a weighted directed graph.

**Input:** A file containing a weighted directed graph, a from_vertex and a to_vertex.

`python3 challenge_3.py graph_data.txt 1 5`

```
D
1,2,3,4,5
(1,2,4)
(1,4,5)
(2,3,6)
(2,4,9)
(2,5,6)
(3,5,10)
```

**Output:**
If there is a path between the vertices (T/F) and the minimum weight path between the vertices.
```
There exists a path between vertex 1 and 5: TRUE
The weight of the minimum weight path between vertex 1 and 5 is: 10
```


### Stretch Challenges 3 : Implement Priority Queue
- (From CS 2.1).  Implement BinaryMinHeap using a dynamic array and then implement Priory Queue using BinaryMinHeap.  See [binary heap starter code](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-2.1-Advanced-Trees-and-Sorting-Algorithms/blob/master/Code/binaryheap.py) and [priority queue starter code](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-2.1-Advanced-Trees-and-Sorting-Algorithms/blob/master/Code/priorityqueue.py) for outline.
